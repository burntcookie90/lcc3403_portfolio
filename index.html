							<h2><a id="ire">Introductory Reflective Essay</a></h2>
							<hr>
							<p>It has been a couple of years since I have taken a class or had a job that emphasized the skill of communication.
							The last time I had to write something to be read by another person was at least a year ago.
							Due to this lack of practice, I can easily say that my ability to communicate my ideas was rather suboptimal.
							Until taking this class, I thought this skill would not be of great use to me in my chosen field of work. 
							However, being able to communication your ideas is both useful and necessary in any field of work, even technical ones.
							I learned how to properly tailor my method of communication to the audience that I am communicating with.
							Additionally, I learned that my skills in application design and layout also apply to my technical communication
							Finally, the group research project taught me how to work in a group of people that I did not choose to work with, a very helpful thing to learn before going to work full time after this semester.</p>

							<p>Though it seems like common sense to write your communication with your readers in mind, it does not always happen that way.
							Before this class, I would take the time to think about the audience that I was directing my communication towards, but never in depth.
							Things like reader's context, professional/cultural characteristics, and an audiences' stake in my writing, never came up during the planning stages.
							I took these ideas and applied them when writing the memo about Georgia Tech's wireless network connection instructions for Ubuntu.
							When writing the memo, I made sure to not be too pushy with my ideas.
							If I was in the group that the memo was directed to, and it was too forceful, I would disregard it as an angry rant rather than a possibly helpful suggestion.
							However, because the memo had the purpose of changing the existing instruction list, I made sure to detail the improvements that could be made.
							Additionally, because this was a professional memo, I made sure the language did not use any colloquialisms as this could cause the reader to, once again, disregard the suggestions that I proposed.</p>

							<p>As a software developer, we usually get the help of user experience designers to help make our products usable by consumers. 
							I have been told that, unlike most developers, I have always tried to design my application with user experience in mind.
							This ability can be seen in the website UI  mock-up that my group and I used for our presentation.
							I utilized many design elements that I have learned over the past years as a software developer in the mock-up.
							Elements such as intuitive navigation, use of whitespace and reduced actions are all included in the design of the website.
							This design practice transfers to other applications as well, such as document design and layouts.
							My resume is designed for ease of data consumption.
							A recruiter reading my resume can quickly find important sections and data on my years at Georgia Tech.
							Such a design is useful in making a good impression with a recruiter while looking for a job.</p>

							<p>The computer science curriculum has many group based project classes.
							However, the groups are usually formed by choice, rather than randomly(or purposefully) chosen for the students.
							Because of this, I am very good at working in groups with my friends, and can usually manage the group and the workload balance gracefully.
							I have rarely needed to deal with a group member that did not perform their responsibilities, or a group member that did felt like their time was better used elsewhere.
							Learning to manage a group of people who I have no chosen was a very helpful skill to learn.
							After this semester I will begin a full-time position in a company that works heavily in groups.
							In industry, you do not always get to choose your team members and you must learn to deal with issues that can arise in such a setting.
							After dealing with such a situation in this class, I think I learned a good bit from the experience that can be brought with me to my position at my company.</p>

							<p> I think the best thing about my submission is the instructional video that I recorded.
							It takes everything from the original source instructions and puts it in an easy to understand, short, format.
							The hardest part of creating it was coming up with ways to improve a set of instructions that were already pretty good to start with.
							I visualized my reader as someone similar to me: good technical knowledge, but average to low communication knowledge.
							By doing this, I was able to voice my ideas and concerns as in a more natural manner.
							My objective was to point out some flaws and areas for improvement in the existing instructions, an objective that I think I met. 
							Overall, I think I deserve a B to B+ on this assignment. 
							Although I feel that I met my own personal objective, I could have had more content and I am not very confident about my grammar skills.</p>

							This assignment definitely helped make my professional documents look more professional.
							The combination of peer reviews and the resume/cover letter checklist were very helpful.
							The easiest part of this assignment was the resume, I already had a resume that was peer reviewed by many people.
							Also, my resume has been submitted to many recruiters, who have complimented it's style and content.
							The most challenging part of the assignment, on the other hand, was the  cover letter.
							The last cover letter that I had written was in high school for a summer internship.
							My lack of experience in writing cover letters and lack of recent writing practice made the task a bit more challenging than I had expected.
							If I had one more hour, I would probably get one more peer review on this draft of the cover letter, as there was still some wording I didn't quite enjoy.
							Before submitting in earnest, I would attempt to make the letter sound a little less...braggy.

							<h2><a id="cs">Closing Statements</a></h2>

							<p>As I mentioned in my introductory reflective essay, it had been sometime since I had practice with technical communication.
							Even though I have a strong sense of design and layout, this is meaningless if it cannot be filled with substantial, purposeful language.
							I learned a lot about taking my ideas, and molding them into a form that is most effective for it's purpose.
							Although many people may flush what they learned after the class is over, I believe what I have learned will come in handy more often than not in industry.</p>

							<p>After graduation, I will be joining a digital media company in Chicago as a Software Developer.
							The job description does not necessarily include the ability to write and communicate ideas with others in the company, however, without this ability, my success with the company will be stunted.
							As a software developer, we do have various documentation to complete in relation to our projects.
							If this documentation is done poorly, it not only makes the developer, but the company as a whole look ineffective.</p>

							<p>The curriculum taught in this class applies to more than just documentation.
							The ability to write thought out, professional emails and memos will be very useful in industry.
							When everyone is busy, no one wants to take the time to read something that was poorly crafted, no matter what it might say.
							By making sure that all my communication is up to the standards established in this class, I can be sure that my communications will be accepted and considered.</p>

							<p>Also, as a non-liberal arts major, I most likely do not need the skills to analyze literary works as taught in English courses.
							I need the ability to write effectively such that my ideas and intents are not struck down due to childish mistakes.
							I personally think this class has been one of the most useful classes I have taken at Georgia Tech.</p>
